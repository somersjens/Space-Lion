"""Round-trip the string catalog through a translator-friendly CSV.

    Tools/translations.py export [--out Translations.csv] [--languages fr,de,es]
    Tools/translations.py import Translations.csv [--dry-run]

The catalog is the source of truth for *structure*: whether a key is a plain
string, varies with a count, or has counted parts inside a longer sentence. The
CSV only ever carries text, so a translator cannot break the shape of a string
by filling in a cell, and the importer knows how to read every cell without
having to guess.

Export writes one row per string — a key that changes with a count gets one row
per grammatical form — with the English source, the Dutch translation and an
Import reads any such file back — including one holding a single language — and
writes what it finds into the catalog, validating as it goes.
