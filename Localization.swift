//  the welcome screens and the premium menu.
//
//  SwiftUI's `Text` resolves its strings from the *main bundle*, not from the
//  environment locale, so changing `\.locale` alone is not enough to swap the
//  language while the app is running. We install a tiny Bundle subclass that
//  redirects `localizedString(...)` to a chosen `.lproj`. Changing the
//  environment locale at the root then re-renders every `Text`, which now
//  reads the redirected strings — a live, no-restart language change.
//
//  English is the source language and the safety net: anything a language has
//  not translated yet — a missing key, or a language with no translations at
//  all — is answered in English rather than left as a raw identifier or handed
//  back to whatever the device happens to be set to.
