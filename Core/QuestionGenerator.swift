//  Number Reef
//
//  Turns a chosen level *and a chosen practice mode* into a validated question.
//
//  The three modes are the same three buttons the menu shows, and they mean
//  exactly what they say:
//
//  · Order  — a fixed, predictable route. No randomness at all: the sums are
//             computed straight from the session's step counter, so the same
//             level always walks the same path (2+2, 2+4, 2+6 …).
//  · Random — this level's own number only, shuffled. Every value comes up
//             exactly once per lap, so the practice stays even without the
//             answers simply counting up.
//  · Mixed  — this level *or a lower one*, jumbled together, leaning on the
//             harder end. This is the route the game generated before the
//             three buttons existed.
//
//  Fractions and Percentages are the two topics whose sub-levels are not
//  ordered at all, so their buttons change the *kind* of sum instead: single
//  versus multiple parts, whole versus decimal answers. See `MathTopic
//  .modeOverride`.
//
//  Supermix has no order to choose: each of its four combinations is its own
//  ladder, and every operation inside it climbs by the rules of its own menu.
//
//  The arithmetic rules are ported from Jumping Fox's QuestionEngine: the
//  distractors are the near-misses children actually produce, never values
//  plucked at random.
